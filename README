crlserver
=========

crlserver is a roguelike server in the spirit of dgamelaunch, but it
manages users logins and scores for far more than just nethack.

Feature:

 * It's free, no cost and GPL'ed.
 * Multiple games
 * Simple configuration
 * SQL abstraction
 * Simple and clean UI

TODO:

 * Support of ttyrec for games record.
 * Support of ttyplay for real time games watching.
 * Configurable menus via the configuration file, like dgamelaunch does.

crlserver is known to run on :
 * Intel running OpenBSD or Ubuntu
 * Lemote Loongson (mips) running OpenBSD

Contribution
------------
There is an important thing to understand if you want to contribute :<br />
I **only** accept ISC licensed patches. No GPL !

Remember that your patches are your own intellectual properties.

How to setup ?
--------------
Compilation:
 * Edit 'pathnames.h', to suit your needs (there is documentation inside).
 * Compile crlserver with BSDmakefile or GNUmakefile.
  
Installation:
 * Put the binary somewhere and the content of 'crlsdir' in the directories
   you have specified in 'pathnames.h'.
 * Create the 'playground' and 'userdata' directories.
 * Create a user (eg: 'crlserver')
 * Edit your sshd_config and add those lines:
    Match User crls
            ForceCommand /path/to/crlserver
 * Alternatively you can use telnet or put crlserver as a login shell
   but it's not the recommended way.
 * Create a crlserver configuration file and put it in /etc or crlserver's home
 * It works (or if not, mail me) !

Configuration:
 * Grab the sample.conf in crlsdir

Why X, my favorite roguelike, is not supported ?
------------------------------------------------

It's really simple to add it !
Open your main configuration file and add a block for your game :

    new game = {
	   name        = "nethack"
	   longname    = "NetHack"
	   version     = "3.4.3"
	   description = "This is the vanilla version of NetHack"
	   key         = 'n'
	   path 	    = "/usr/games/nethack"
	   params      = "-u %u"
    }

You can do the same thing for text editors.

I'm on Windows and I want to run crlserver.
-------------------------------------------
Windows is not supported and not a targeted platform.<br />
It's designed to work on Unix-like systems.
